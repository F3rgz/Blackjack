This project is build using ink, which uses React to provide a flexible component based UI on the command line.
This simplified the development of the UI allowing me to focus more on the code, while demonstrating my React knowledge.

The code is transpiled using Babel to allow me access to handy ES6 utilities such as spread and other array operations, as well as the import method.
